# Colored segmentation: The calculated feature is available for that nucleus.
# Grey segmentation: The calculated feature is not available for that nucleus. This could be because the nuclear segmentation is an outlier at that time point (i.e. touching the edge of the field of view (FOV), identified as an erroneous segmentation or tracking) or the feature could not be calculated (i.e. features that require the full-interphase trajectory).
